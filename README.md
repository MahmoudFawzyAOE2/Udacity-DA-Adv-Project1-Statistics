# Udacity-DA-Adv-Project1-Statistics-testing

this project is a part of Udacity Data Analysis Advanced Nanodegree Program.    
it's the first project out of 2 projects.     

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.
Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# The Dataset
2 files (ab_data.csv & countries.csv)

#Part I - Probability   
  here we'll compute some basic statistics to explore the data.
  
#Part II - A/B Test   
  testing the relation between converting rate and pagy type.       

#Part III - A regression approach     
  another method to make sure of the results and to find some other relations
